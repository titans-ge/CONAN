# WASP-121 Phase curve analysis

`WASP121_TESS_pc.ipynb` notebook demonstrates:

- Downloading and saving TESS data

- Fitting phase curve in CONAN accounting for light travel time delay across the orbit

- Accounting for contamination in the aperture

- automatically get polynomial order for detrending
