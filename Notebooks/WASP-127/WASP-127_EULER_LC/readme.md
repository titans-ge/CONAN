# WASP-127 ground based LCs

Notebook demonstrates:

- joint fit of several ground based data with ancillary data for decorrelating the flux
- Data preprocessing: outlier clipping and data rescaling
- getting best combination of decorrelation vectors for ground based analysis
- making custom plots from result object
