# WASP-127 LC-RV analysis

Notebook demonstrates:

- joint lightcurve and radial velocity fit
- Downloading TESS data
- Supersampling long-cadence data
- working with ground-based data with ancillary data
- Getting system parameters from NASA archive
- getting best decorrelation vectors for ground based LC and RV data
- GP fitting
- making custom plots from result object
